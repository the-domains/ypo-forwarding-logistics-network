            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Tesla Will Destroy the Automobile Industry</h1><p>If there's an example of a company about to disruptively innovate an entire industry, it's Tesla.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sevenhugs' Smart Remote</h1><p>Looking to simplify the endless number of apps and interfaces used to control smart-home products, French start-up Sevenhugs has introduced the first "contextually aware" universal Smart Remote.

It no longer seems like such a goofy idea</h1><p>Throughout our planet's space-faring history, there have been two major impediments to putting a lot of private citizens into orbit. Only governments have had spacecraft, and there have been only a few, government-controlled, space stations to visit.
